Dear brave soul,

so you have decided to try to build the tower toppler datafile on your
own. To make this possible here are a few hints.

1. Software requirements

- gimp with script-fu support
- povray
- c compiler
- libz and libpng

then simply delete the toppler.dat from the main directory and type

make

and the datafile should be re-created from the data in here
